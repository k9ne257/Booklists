"# bookLists" 
= Project Overview

This project is a chance for me to combine and practice everything I learned in the Udacity Nanodegree program. I will be making an app that lists books.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. I will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

== Why this project?

This project gives you the ability to practice how to get data from an api, how to parse that data and display it to a user, which will be key in developing any app which makes use of a backend server, real time data, or interactions over the internet.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Fetching data from an API
- Using an AsyncTask
- Parsing a JSON response
- Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
